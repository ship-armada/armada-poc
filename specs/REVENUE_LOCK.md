# Revenue-Lock Contract — Behavior Spec

## 1. Purpose

A single shared contract that holds all early network ARM (2,400,000 total) and releases it to beneficiaries as cumulative protocol revenue milestones are reached. This is the enforcement mechanism for revenue-gated token unlocks described in GOVERNANCE.md and ARM_TOKEN.md.

**This is a contract behavior spec.** It defines what the contract does, what it reads, and what it guarantees.

## 2. Architecture

```
RevenueCounter (UUPS proxy, governance-upgradeable)
  └── recognizedRevenueUsd() → uint256

RevenueLock (immutable, non-upgradeable)
  ├── reads: RevenueCounter.recognizedRevenueUsd() — via ratchet only
  ├── stores: maxObservedRevenue (monotonic, rate-limited)
  ├── stores: lastSyncTimestamp (advances unconditionally on every sync)
  ├── immutable: MAX_REVENUE_INCREASE_PER_DAY
  ├── holds: 2,400,000 ARM (early network)
  ├── tracks: per-beneficiary allocations and released amounts
  └── releases: ARM to beneficiary wallet + delegates atomically via delegateOnBehalf()

ARM Token
  ├── whitelist includes RevenueLock address (constructor-set)
  └── delegateOnBehalf() callable by RevenueLock (constructor-set)
```

RevenueLock never reads `RevenueCounter.recognizedRevenueUsd()` directly for entitlement calculations. All reads go through `_updateMaxObservedRevenue()`, which enforces the monotonic ratchet and rate cap before updating `maxObservedRevenue`. Entitlement is always computed from `maxObservedRevenue`, not the raw counter value.

## 3. Deployment

### Constructor parameters

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ARM token address | Immutable | Must match the ARM token that whitelists this contract |
| RevenueCounter address | Immutable | UUPS proxy address — implementation may be upgraded by governance, but the proxy address never changes |
| Beneficiary list | Immutable | Array of `(address beneficiary, uint256 allocationAmount)` pairs. Set once at deployment. |
| Milestone table | Immutable | The revenue-to-unlock-percentage mapping. Hardcoded or constructor-set. Cannot be changed after deployment. |
| `MAX_REVENUE_INCREASE_PER_DAY` | Immutable | Maximum rate at which `maxObservedRevenue` can advance per elapsed day. Set at deployment; not governance-settable. See PARAMETER_MANIFEST.md. |

Constructor must initialize: `maxObservedRevenue = 0`, `lastSyncTimestamp = block.timestamp`. The sync timestamp **must not** be left as 0 — a zero timestamp would allow the first call to accumulate the entire elapsed-time allowance since the Unix epoch and bypass the rate limit entirely.

### Post-deployment setup

ARM is distributed to this contract as part of the bootstrap-holder distribution sequence (see ARM_TOKEN.md §3). After distribution: `ARM.balanceOf(revenueLockContract) == 2_400_000e18`.

### Deployment order

There are circular dependencies across the contract set. The ARM token constructor needs immutable references to: revenue-lock (whitelist + `delegateOnBehalf`), crowdfund (whitelist + `delegateOnBehalf`), treasury (whitelist + delegation revert), governor executor / timelock (`setTransferable` caller), wind-down contract (`setTransferable` caller), and bootstrap holder (whitelist). The revenue-lock constructor needs the ARM token address and the RevenueCounter address.

**Recommended: CREATE2 precomputed addresses.** Compute all contract addresses before deploying any of them. The full set that may need precomputation: ARM token, RevenueLock, RevenueCounter proxy, Governor/Timelock, WindDown contract, and CrowdfundContract. Deploy in any order — all constructors use the precomputed addresses.

---

## 4. Beneficiary List

Set at deployment. Cannot be modified after deployment.

| Beneficiary | Allocation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Recipient 1 | `[amount]` | |
| Recipient 2 | `[amount]` | |
| ... | ... | ... |
| Knowable Safe | `[amount]` | Reserve for future contributors. Released ARM distributed off-chain via token agreements after global transfer unlock. |
| ... | ... | ... |

**Total must equal exactly 2,400,000 ARM.** The contract should verify this at deployment.

**No post-deployment modifications.** There is no function to add, remove, or change beneficiaries. There is no admin role. The Knowable Safe handles future contributor allocation off-chain after its ARM is released and global transfers are enabled — the lock contract doesn't need to know about this.

---

## 5. Milestone Table

The revenue-to-unlock mapping. Immutable after deployment.

| Cumulative Revenue (USD) | Unlocked % |
|---|---|
| $0 | 0% |
| $10,000 | 10% |
| $50,000 | 25% |
| $100,000 | 40% |
| $250,000 | 60% |
| $500,000 | 80% |
| $1,000,000 | 100% |

**No interpolation.** Unlock percentage is a step function — at $49,999 revenue, unlock is 10%; at $50,000, it jumps to 25%.

**No time-based fallback.** If revenue never reaches $1M, tokens never fully unlock. There is no calendar-based override.

---

## 6. Release Mechanism

### `release(address delegatee)`

The only state-changing function a beneficiary calls.

**Preconditions:**
- `msg.sender` is a beneficiary in the list
- `delegatee != address(0)`

**Logic:**
1. Call `_updateMaxObservedRevenue()` — advances `maxObservedRevenue` and `lastSyncTimestamp` before any entitlement calculation
2. Look up the unlock percentage from the milestone table (step function, using `maxObservedRevenue`)
3. Compute entitled amount: `unlockPercentage × allocation[msg.sender]`
4. Compute releasable amount: `entitled - alreadyReleased[msg.sender]`
5. If releasable == 0: revert (nothing new to release)
6. Update `alreadyReleased[msg.sender] += releasable`
7. Call `ARM.transfer(msg.sender, releasable)` — succeeds because this contract is whitelisted
8. Call `ARM.delegateOnBehalf(msg.sender, delegatee)` — succeeds because this contract is an authorized caller

**Step 1 detail — `_updateMaxObservedRevenue()`:**
```
reported = RevenueCounter.recognizedRevenueUsd()
elapsed = block.timestamp - lastSyncTimestamp
maxAllowedIncrease = (elapsed * MAX_REVENUE_INCREASE_PER_DAY) / 1 days
capped = min(reported, maxObservedRevenue + maxAllowedIncrease)
if capped > maxObservedRevenue:
    emit ObservedRevenueUpdated(maxObservedRevenue, capped, reported)
    maxObservedRevenue = capped
lastSyncTimestamp = block.timestamp  // unconditional — always advances
```

`lastSyncTimestamp` advances on every call regardless of whether `maxObservedRevenue` changed. This is the mechanism that makes regular syncs meaningful — each sync consumes the elapsed-time allowance budget.

### `syncObservedRevenue()`

Permissionless. Calls `_updateMaxObservedRevenue()` without releasing ARM. Any address can call this. Intended for monitoring bots that keep the ratchet current without requiring a beneficiary to claim.

**Events:**
```
Released(address indexed beneficiary, uint256 amount, address delegatee, uint256 cumulativeReleased)
ObservedRevenueUpdated(uint256 oldMax, uint256 newMax, uint256 reportedByCounter)
```

`ObservedRevenueUpdated` is emitted on every actual ratchet advance (when `maxObservedRevenue` increases), by both `release()` and `syncObservedRevenue()`.

**Properties:**
- **Pull-based.** Beneficiaries call `release()` when they want. There is no push mechanism. ARM sits in the contract until claimed.
- **Atomic transfer + delegation.** Released ARM enters circulation already delegated, matching the crowdfund `claim(delegate)` pattern. No ARM enters circulation undelegated.
- **Ratchet-first.** Entitlement is always computed from `maxObservedRevenue`, never from a direct read of `RevenueCounter.recognizedRevenueUsd()`. This makes the contract immune to RevenueCounter rewind attacks.
- **Rate-limited.** `maxObservedRevenue` can only advance at `MAX_REVENUE_INCREASE_PER_DAY` per elapsed day since last sync. Acceleration requires real elapsed time.
- **Delegation applies to full balance.** Step 8 calls `delegateOnBehalf(msg.sender, delegatee)`, which sets the beneficiary's entire ARM delegation — not just the newly released tokens. This matches standard ERC20Votes behavior (one delegatee per address).
- **Idempotent.** Calling `release()` when nothing new is unlocked reverts harmlessly. Calling it multiple times between milestones is safe — `alreadyReleased` tracks cumulative releases.

## 7. View Functions

| Function | Returns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `allocation(address beneficiary)` | uint256 | Total allocation for this beneficiary |
| `released(address beneficiary)` | uint256 | Total ARM already released to this beneficiary |
| `releasable(address beneficiary)` | uint256 | ARM currently available to release, computed from `maxObservedRevenue` |
| `unlockPercentage()` | uint256 (bps) | Current unlock percentage based on `maxObservedRevenue` (not raw counter) |
| `currentRevenue()` | uint256 | Current value of `maxObservedRevenue` (the ratcheted, rate-limited observation — not `RevenueCounter.recognizedRevenueUsd()` directly) |
| `getCappedObservedRevenue()` | uint256 | What `maxObservedRevenue` would become if `syncObservedRevenue()` were called right now. Read-only: does not modify state or advance `lastSyncTimestamp`. Use for monitoring dashboards. |
| `maxObservedRevenue` | uint256 | Current active ratchet value. Monotonically non-decreasing. |
| `lastSyncTimestamp` | uint256 | Timestamp of last `_updateMaxObservedRevenue()` call. Advances unconditionally. |
| `beneficiaryCount()` | uint256 | Number of beneficiaries |

## 8. What This Contract Does NOT Do

| Absent capability | Why |
|---|---|
| No admin role | Beneficiary list and milestone table are immutable |
| No `addBeneficiary()` or `removeBeneficiary()` | List is set at deployment and cannot change |
| No `reassign()` | Future contributor allocation is handled off-chain by Knowable after release |
| No `delegate()` on behalf of unreleased tokens | Unreleased ARM sits in this contract; this contract has no delegation code path for its own balance — unreleased ARM is structurally vote-inert |
| No upgradeability | No proxy, no UUPS. Deployed bytecode is final. |
| No wind-down interaction | If wind-down triggers, this contract is unaffected. Unreleased ARM stays locked. Beneficiaries can still call `release()` if milestones have been reached. If the protocol never earned enough revenue, the tokens simply stay here. |
| No `withdrawAll()` or sweep function | ARM can only leave via `release()` to the entitled beneficiary. No backdoor. |

---

## 9. Invariants

| Invariant | Description |
|---|---|
| **Supply conservation** | `ARM.balanceOf(this) + sum(alreadyReleased[all beneficiaries]) == totalAllocation` at all times |
| **Monotonic releases** | `alreadyReleased[beneficiary]` never decreases |
| **Milestone table is immutable** | No code path modifies the unlock schedule after deployment |
| **Beneficiary list is immutable** | No code path adds, removes, or modifies beneficiaries after deployment |
| **Unreleased ARM is vote-inert** | This contract has no `delegate()` call path for its own balance. ARM sitting here has zero voting power. |
| **Released ARM is always delegated** | Every `release()` call atomically delegates via `delegateOnBehalf()`. No ARM enters circulation undelegated. |
| **No over-release** | `alreadyReleased[beneficiary] <= allocation[beneficiary]` at all times |
| **`maxObservedRevenue` is monotonic** | `maxObservedRevenue` never decreases. RevenueCounter downgrades are invisible to this contract. |
| **`maxObservedRevenue` is rate-limited** | `maxObservedRevenue` can increase by at most `MAX_REVENUE_INCREASE_PER_DAY × elapsed_days` per call to `_updateMaxObservedRevenue()`. |
| **`lastSyncTimestamp` advances unconditionally** | Every call to `_updateMaxObservedRevenue()` (via `release()` or `syncObservedRevenue()`) updates `lastSyncTimestamp = block.timestamp`, regardless of whether `maxObservedRevenue` changed. |
| **Entitlement never reads counter directly** | No code path computes entitlement from `RevenueCounter.recognizedRevenueUsd()` directly. All entitlement calculations use `maxObservedRevenue`. |

---

## 10. Wind-Down Interaction

If `triggerWindDown()` is called on the wind-down contract:

- This contract is **unaffected**. It has no wind-down awareness.
- Unreleased ARM stays locked. If revenue milestones haven't been reached, the tokens remain here permanently.
- Already-released ARM is in beneficiaries' wallets and is part of the "circulating" supply eligible for pro-rata treasury distribution.
- Wind-down automatically enables global ARM transfers (`setTransferable(true)`), so beneficiaries who have released ARM can move it to claim their treasury share.

**This is the intended fairness property:** those who paid (crowdfund participants) have priority in failure scenarios. Early network tokens only unlock if the protocol earns revenue — if it failed before earning revenue, those tokens stay locked and have no claim on remaining assets.

---

## 11. Custom Grants (Future)

**The revenue-gated lock mechanism is a one-time launch construct.** There are no future custom lock contracts with revenue gating or independent milestone tables.

After governance enables global transfers, custom grants are standard treasury transfers via governance proposal. The recipient receives ARM in their wallet and delegates via standard `delegate()`. No lock contract, no atomic delegation, no whitelisting needed.

This simplifies the system:
- No registry of lock contracts for wind-down denominator calculations
- No need to extend `delegateOnBehalf` authorization beyond the two launch contracts
- The wind-down redemption denominator can hardcode the four known excluded addresses (treasury, shared revenue-lock, crowdfund, redemption contract) permanently
